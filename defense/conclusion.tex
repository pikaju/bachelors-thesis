    \begin{itemize}
        \item The data suggests a performance improvement when modifying MuZero using the proposed loss functions
        \item MuZero can be trained in a self-supervised fashion, but caution is advised
        \item Future work could solve more difficult environments and perform a hyperparameter search
        \item Source code will be made available at \url{https://github.com/pikaju/bachelors-thesis}
