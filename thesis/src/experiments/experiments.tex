\section{Experiments}
We hypothesize that the proposed methods would improve the performance of the MuZero algorithm. We will now perform several experiments to test and ideally validate this hypothesis.

Note that, in artificial intelligence research and reinforcmeent learning in particular, training processes are stochastic, meaning we need to repeat experiments many times to get statistically significant results. Furthermore, the algorithms are often fragile and highly sensitive to hyperparameter changes. Errors in the implementation are sometimes difficult to find or even notice, given that their impact on the algorithm's performance may be minor.
