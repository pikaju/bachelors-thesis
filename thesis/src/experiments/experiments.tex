\section{Experiments}
We will now perform several experiments to test and ideally validate our hypothesis that the proposed methods improve the performance of the MuZero algorithm.

Note that, in artificial intelligence research, training processes are stochastic, meaning we need to repeat experiments many times to get statistically significant results. Furthermore, in reinforcement learning in particular, the algorithms are often fragile and highly sensitive to hyperparameter changes. Errors in the implementation are sometimes difficult to find or even notice, given that their impact on the algorithm's performance may be minor.
