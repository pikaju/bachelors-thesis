\section{Background}
In this chapter, we introduce some of the fundamentals necessary to fully understand the changes we set out to make further on. In particular, we look at reinforcement learning from a more mathematical standpoint and give a brief overview of its history. We also describe model-based reinforcement learning formally, before finally explaining the MuZero Algorithm.
