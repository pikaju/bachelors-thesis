\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}
\textit{Reinforcement learning} is the act of learning a mapping from \textit{observations} to \textit{actions} so as to maximize a real-valued \textit{reward}. In contrast to another learning paradigm, \textit{supervised learning}, the learner is not told which actions result in the largest reward for different observations. Instead, an agent must try out different actions in different situations to discover a useful behavior. \cite{sutton}

The principles behind reinforcement learning are inspired by the way animals learn. Behavioral psychology has found that actions can be encouraged or surpressed when they are followed up with positive or negative stimuli \cite{thorndike}.
